# Feature Prioritization for Helicopter Game

## Objective
Identify features that maintain the core value proposition while being achievable within 5 class days. Features are categorized into **P0 (Essential)**, **P1 (Important)**, and **P2 (Nice-to-have)** based on their importance and feasibility. Simplify features where possible while preserving core functionality.

---

## Feature Prioritization

### Game Configuration
- **P0:** Core configuration parameters (`type`, `width`, `height`, `physics`, `scene`)
  - *Rationale:* These are required to initialize the game engine and ensure the game runs.
- **P1:** Physics debug rendering (`debug: false`)
  - *Rationale:* Enhances debugging during development but is not critical for the MVP.
- **P2:** Advanced rendering optimizations (e.g., WebGL-specific features)
  - *Rationale:* Can improve performance in future iterations but not necessary for MVP.

---

### Scenes

#### MenuScene
- **P0:** `preload()` and `create()`
  - *Rationale:* Required to load assets and create the menu interface for basic functionality.
- **P1:** Leaderboard integration
  - *Rationale:* Adds significant value but can be omitted initially.
- **P2:** Custom animations for menu transitions
  - *Rationale:* Aesthetic improvement, not critical for functionality.

#### GameScene
- **P0:** `preload()`, `create()`, `update()`, and `handleCollisions()`
  - *Rationale:* Essential for game logic, physics, and player interaction.
- **P1:** `spawnPickup()`
  - *Rationale:* Adds variety to gameplay but not necessary for the basic experience.
- **P2:** Dynamic level generation based on player performance
  - *Rationale:* Advanced feature for replayability in future iterations.

### Game Objects

#### HelicopterSprite
- **P0:** Core mechanics (`create()`, `update()`, `handleInput()`, `applyThrust()`)
  - *Rationale:* Essential for player control and gameplay.
- **P1:** Turret mechanics (`rotateTurret()`, `fire()`)
  - *Rationale:* Adds combat functionality but can be secondary to core flight mechanics.
- **P2:** Detailed damage effects and animations
  - *Rationale:* Enhances visuals, not core to initial functionality.

#### Enemy
- **P0:** Basic AI and behavior (`update()`)
  - *Rationale:* Essential to provide obstacles for the player.
- **P1:** Advanced attack patterns (`attack()`)
  - *Rationale:* Enhances gameplay variety but not critical for MVP.
- **P2:** Dynamic difficulty scaling
  - *Rationale:* Nice-to-have for long-term engagement.

---

### Managers

#### LevelManager
- **P0:** Basic level generation (`generateLevel()`, `createPlatform()`)
  - *Rationale:* Core to creating playable levels.
- **P1:** `spawnEnemies()`, `spawnPickups()`
  - *Rationale:* Adds challenge and resource management mechanics but not critical.
- **P2:** Dynamic level adjustments during gameplay
  - *Rationale:* Adds depth but can be delayed.

---

### UI Components

#### HUD
- **P0:** Core indicators (`updateHealth()`, `updateFuel()`, `updateScore()`)
  - *Rationale:* Ensures players can track critical resources.
- **P1:** `updateAmmo()`
  - *Rationale:* Important if turret mechanics are included but secondary otherwise.
- **P2:** Animated UI transitions
  - *Rationale:* Visual enhancement for future versions.

## Implementation Notes

### P0 (Must Have - Days 1-3)
- Game configuration setup
- Core menu functionality
- Basic game mechanics (player movement, collisions)
- Essential UI components (health, fuel, score)
- Basic enemy AI and level generation

### P1 (Should Have - Days 4-5)
- Leaderboard integration
- Turret and combat mechanics
- Advanced enemy behavior and pickups
- Remaining UI components (ammo)

### P2 (Future Iterations)
- Visual and performance enhancements
- Dynamic level adjustments
- Custom animations and advanced gameplay features

## Documented Decisions
1. **Simplification:** Removed debug rendering and animations from the MVP.
2. **Technical Compromise:** Delayed dynamic difficulty scaling for basic AI.
3. **Focus:** Prioritized playable core gameplay over secondary features like leaderboard integration.
